TODO:

Need to mark a process for shutdown, this could be done in a few different ways:
- could pass name of process or PID to LKM as parameter when loading (could eventually be configured in file)
- could directly edit the /proc filesystem to mark as such

Need to add a parameter to the process struct (tldp.org/LDP/lki/lki-2.html), this will certainly require recompiling the kernel.
- could add a process state flag and leverage existing, but this will consider some significant changes
- could create a new field for a process
- could leverage the existing field of p->personality which is teh way certain system calls behave in order to emulate the "personality" of foreign flavors of linux

Need to get list of all processes and add their graceful shutdown indicator into a list in the proc filesystem
