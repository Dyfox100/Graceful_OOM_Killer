TODO:

Need to get list of all processes and add their graceful shutdown indicator into a list in the proc filesystem

Need to mark a process for shutdown, this could be done in a few different ways:
- could pass name of process or PID to LKM as parameter when loading (could eventually be configured in file)
- could directly edit the /proc filesystem to mark as such
- could have /proc file list only processes for graceful shutdown and any associated information needed
- could to add a parameter to the process struct (tldp.org/LDP/lki/lki-2.html), this will certainly require recompiling the kernel including leverage the existing field of p->personality which is teh way certain system calls behave in order to emulate the "personality" of foreign flavors of linux
